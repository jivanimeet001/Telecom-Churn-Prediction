# TELECOM CHURN PREDICTION
Customer churn is a key issue in the telecom business, as incumbent operators have made maintaining high-profitable customers a top goal. Using customer-level data, this research seeks to anticipate customer attrition in a prominent telecom corporation. The project entails defining churn, studying consumer behaviour during churn, preparing data, creating features, and developing prediction models. To develop successful prediction models, the project leverages dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and manages class imbalance. A logistic regression or tree-based model is also created to discover relevant predictor features. The project's findings will assist the telecom operator in taking targeted efforts to reduce churn and boost customer retention.

## INTRODUCTION
Customer churn, or the frequency at which customers transfer operators, presents a serious problem in the fiercely competitive telecom sector. The top business objective for current operators is to keep highly profitable clients. For telecom businesses to attain this goal, forecasting client attrition becomes essential. This study uses customer-level data to examine the problem of customer turnover at a top telecom company.
The goal of the project is to comprehend customer behaviour during churn and create prediction models to find customers 

who are most likely to leave. In order to achieve this, three separate customer lifecycle phases—the "good" phase, the "action" phase, and the "churn" phase—are recognized. The idea of churn is also established. The telecom business would be able to take targeted measures and interventions during critical periods of client attrition by being aware of these phases.
In this project, data pre-processing and feature engineering are crucial processes because they set the groundwork for developing powerful prediction models. The analysis focuses on predicting last-month churn using data from the first three months by generating new characteristics based on business insights and filtering high-value clients. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and appropriate procedures are used to address the large number of attributes and class imbalance.
Furthermore, the research entails developing a logistic regression model or a tree-based model to discover critical predictor qualities that drive churn. Understanding these crucial churn indicators can help the telecom operator make informed decisions to reduce customer attrition.
Finally, the project's findings will enable the telecom operator to deploy targeted initiatives, such as special plans, recharge discounts, or service quality enhancements, to reduce churn and boost customer retention. By efficiently handling churn, the company can improve its position in the competitive telecom industry and build long-term client loyalty.

## METHODOLOGY
1. Data Collection and Exploration: 
The first stage in the process is to obtain customer-level data from a large telecommunications company. Call usage, internet activity, recharge habits, and client demographics are all included in the dataset. Data exploration is performed to study variable distribution, uncover missing values, and get insights into consumer behaviour during various stages of turnover.
2. Definition of Churn and Analysis of Customer Behaviour:
The project defines churn in terms of income or consumption, depending on the type of the telecom services (prepaid or postpaid). To better understand customer behaviour during churn, the 'good,' 'activity,' and 'churn' phases of the customer lifecycle are identified. Analysing customer behaviour during these stages gives useful information for successful churn prediction and intervention efforts.
3. Data Preparation and Feature Engineering: 
Preparing the dataset for predictive modelling requires careful data preparation. To gather valuable insights linked to customer turnover, new features are derived based on business expertise. High-value clients are selected based on recharge amounts, whereas churners are labelled based on call usage and data activity during the churn phase. The churn phase's attributes are eliminated from the dataset.
4. Predictive Model Building: 
Machine learning techniques are used to develop predictive models to forecast churn in the previous month. To efficiently manage a large number of attributes, dimensionality reduction approaches such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used. To mitigate the low churn rate and increase model performance, class imbalance approaches such as oversampling or ensemble methods are used.
5. Identifying Critical Predictor Attributes:
To find the most relevant predictor qualities that signal customer turnover, a separate model, such as logistic regression or tree-based models, is created. To provide accurate and interpretable findings, multicollinearity is treated. The predictor features chosen will help the telecom company analyse critical churn indicators and make informed decisions to retain valuable clients.
6. Model Evaluation: 
The performance of predictive models is assessed using relevant business-related metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. The chosen model is justified by its capacity to reliably identify churners, which is necessary for effective intervention efforts.
7. Recommendations: 
Based on the study and findings, the project finishes with recommendations for efficiently managing client attrition. The insights gathered from the prediction models and identified important predictor qualities will help the telecom operator to apply focused tactics to reduce churn and promote customer retention, such as customised plans, discounts, or service improvements.

## TRAINING AND TESTING
#### LOGISTIC REGRESSION
To assess the effectiveness of our predictive model for customer turnover in the telecom sector, we split the dataset into a train set (80% of the data) and a test set (20% of the data). The model's astounding 86% accuracy on the train set demonstrated its capacity to distinguish between cases of churn and those that are not. Notably, the model had an 89% recall rate and successfully identified real churners. The specificity (83%) showed how well the algorithm could identify non-churn occurrences. However, the model's precision dramatically decreased to 14% when tested on the test set's unseen data, which had an impact on the final F1-score (24%). The model's accuracy needs to be increased for practical applications, which calls for more investigation.

#### SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE(SVM)
The prediction model showed promise with an accuracy of 86% in the training set. It showed strong memory (89%), demonstrating its capacity to recognize real churners. The model's high specificity (83%) demonstrated how well it could identify non-churners. The percentage of accurate positive forecasts among all positive predictions, or precision, was 84%. The F1-score, however, was only 24%, which suggests a trade-off between recall and precision. Surprisingly, the model maintained a comparable accuracy of 86% on the test set. Even though recall marginally dropped to 82%, the model's capacity to identify churners remained high. Precision on the test set was 14%, which suggests that preventing false positives will be difficult. Overall, the model shows promise for churn prediction, but more refinement is needed to increase F1-score and precision.

#### DECISION TREE
With an accuracy of 90%, the evaluation of the training set shows encouraging results. The model has a high recall (93%), demonstrating its accuracy in identifying genuine positives. Additionally, the specificity is remarkable at 86%, demonstrating the model's ability to recognize real negatives. The model's accuracy in predicting positive instances is indicated by the precision, which is 87%. The F1-score, however, is just 24%, which may be a result of an uneven class distribution. The model maintains a comparable accuracy of 90% on the test set, but the recall falls to 68%, which affects the detection of true positives. At 14%, the precision is also decreased, indicating difficulties in making accurate positive predictions. The F1-score stays the same at 24%.

#### RANDOM FOREST
With an accuracy of 0.86 in the training set, the predictive model shown promising performance with an accuracy rate of 86%. The model successfully identified 87% of the churn cases with a high recall of 0.87. The specificity, which measures how well non-churn cases can be identified, was 0.85. The precision, which gauges how well churn predictions were made, was 0.85. The F1-score, however, was just 0.24, which indicated a trade-off between recall and precision. The model kept its capacity to predict with a similar accuracy of 0.86 in the test set. Recall (0.75) and precision (0.15) both decreased, demonstrating difficulties in accurately detecting churn situations while reducing false positives. The model's performance balance was highlighted by the F1-score's consistency at 0.24.

## RESULTS
I observed that conventional Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models both performed very well in accomplishing our primary goal of optimizing sensitivity after completing extensive model testing. The capacity of the model to precisely identify positive cases—in this instance, churners—is referred to as sensitivity. Both models successfully identified consumers who were at risk of leaving their business, achieving a sensitivity of about 81%. Our models also showed a high overall accuracy of 85%, demonstrating their dependability in producing accurate predictions. These outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy for anticipating client attrition and emphasize the need of sensitivity in our predictive modelling procedure.
Here are some business recommendations based on the findings:
1.	During the action phase (typically in August), the company should focus on targeting customers who use fewer minutes for incoming local calls and outgoing International Subscriber Dialling (ISD) calls. These customers are more likely to consider switching to another operator.
2.	Identifying customers who pay more for outgoing services in July than their incoming services in August is crucial. The company can target these customers with special offers or promotions to encourage them to stay with the current services.
3.	Customers experiencing higher value-based costs during the action phase are at a higher risk of churning. Offering tailored deals or discounts to these customers may help retain them.
4.	Paying attention to customers with higher monthly 3G recharge rates in August can be beneficial. These customers may be more inclined to churn, and providing incentives or personalized plans can improve retention.
5.	Customers who used fewer STD inbound minutes on fixed T lines from operators T in August should be monitored closely. These customers are more likely to churn and may require targeted retention efforts.
6.	Identifying customers with low 2G data usage in August is important. These customers are at higher risk of churn and may benefit from promotional offers or service enhancements.
7.	Customers who used fewer incoming minutes on fixed T lines from operators in August should be considered as potential churners. Taking proactive steps to address their concerns or offering attractive packages can aid in retention.
8.	The variable "roam_og_mou_8" has a positive coefficient, indicating that customers using more roaming outbound minutes are prone to churn. Addressing their roaming needs and offering suitable roaming plans can improve customer retention.
By implementing these recommendations, the telecom company can effectively reduce churn rates, enhance customer loyalty, and improve overall business performance.
